# Neural_Net_Final_Project
This repository contains two implementation of the final project of the course "Introduction to Neural networks" that i take this semester .All codes are implemented from scratch using MATLAB .Although the final proposal is in MATLAB , the same code , with different syntax , in any other programming language ,with slightly different methods , will do the job.The idea is to take two images , extract their features , feed them into a PERCEPTRON and train to find the optimal decision boundary,weight and bias .Using the optimal Weight, Bias we can find the network response to any photo .The accurcy of the network is close to 60% , and this is very good if we take into consideration that this is only a 1-layer ,single neuron , feedforward ,and linear decision boundarty Network .
